# Brian Buchanan — Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio repository.

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which showcases my background in actuarial science, finance, and data analytics, along with a curated set of applied projects focused on real-world business and financial problems.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate how I approach analysis, structure problems, and translate data into insights that support decision-making.

## Introduction

Hello, and thank you for visiting.

My name is Brian Buchanan. I am an Actuarial Science graduate with a strong interest in finance, analytics, risk, and strategy. This website serves as a central place to present my professional background, technical skill set, and applied project work.

In this repository, you will find:
- The full website structure (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Pages outlining my background, skills, and professional goals
- A portfolio of analytics, finance, and actuarial-adjacent projects

## About Me & My Professional Journey

I hold a degree in Actuarial Science and began my academic journey at Queensborough Community College before transferring to Baruch College. My background is rooted in quantitative problem-solving, financial reasoning, and understanding the “why” behind numbers.

Alongside my academic training, I have passed the FINRA Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) exam and completed state insurance licensing, which strengthened my understanding of financial products, regulation, and risk concepts.

I am particularly interested in roles where analytics, finance, and business strategy intersect, and where technical work supports real operational or financial decisions.

## Projects

The projects featured on this site reflect my applied learning and independent work outside of formal coursework.

Project characteristics:
- Built using publicly available datasets and industry-style problem statements
- Focused on business, financial, actuarial, or operational insights
- Extended beyond simple exploratory exercises
- Structured to mirror real-world analytical workflows

While some datasets or project ideas originated from data platforms or public data sources, **all analysis, modeling, dashboards, interpretations, and documentation were produced by me**.

Many projects were developed or refined using **AI-assisted workflows** as productivity and validation tools. All assumptions, logic, decisions, and final outputs were reviewed and controlled by me.

AI tools were used to accelerate learning and execution — not to replace understanding or ownership of the work.

## Website Structure

- `/v2/` contains the active version of the site
- Navigation is shared across pages for consistency
- The site is hosted using GitHub Pages

This repository represents an independently built portfolio, not a bootcamp-generated or course-provided template.
