## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio repository.

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which highlights my background in actuarial science, finance, and data analytics, along with a collection of applied projects focused on real-world business and financial decision-making.

This site serves as a central place to present my professional journey, technical skill set, and hands-on analytical work.

## About Me & Professional Journey

I am an Actuarial Science graduate who began my academic journey at Queensborough Community College and completed my degree at Baruch College. My background is rooted in quantitative problem-solving, financial reasoning, and understanding the “why” behind numbers.

Alongside my academic training, I passed the FINRA Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) exam and completed state insurance licensing, strengthening my understanding of financial products, regulation, pricing, and risk concepts.

I am particularly interested in roles where analytics, finance, and business strategy intersect, and where data-driven insights support real operational or financial decisions.

## Projects

The projects featured on this site reflect my independent, applied work outside of formal coursework.

Project characteristics:
- Built using publicly available datasets and industry-style problem statements
- Focused on business, financial, actuarial, or operational insights
- Extended beyond simple exploratory exercises
- Structured to resemble real-world analytical workflows

While some datasets or project ideas originated from data platforms or public data sources, **all analysis, modeling, code, dashboards, interpretations, and documentation were produced by me**.

Many projects were developed or refined using **AI-assisted workflows** as productivity and validation tools. All assumptions, logic, analytical decisions, and final outputs were reviewed and controlled by me.

AI tools were used to accelerate learning and execution, not to replace understanding, ownership, or responsibility for the work.
